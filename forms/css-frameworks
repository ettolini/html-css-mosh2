-   CSS Frameworks

There are various CSS Frameworks that are used to make styling faster and easier. Bootstrap and Milligram are some of those.

To use Bootstrap, you'd need to copy its link to your HTML doc, and check out the classes' styles.
There are certain styles applied for certain classes, all you need to do is check which class has which style,
and then apply the wanted style to the wanted element by giving it the needed class name.

To use Milligram, you'd need to copy its link to your HTML doc, and then it'll apply all of its minimalistic style to your elements.
There are also a few classes for you to apply more styles to your doc as well!

Whichever style you choose, you can use them and apply your personal CSS at the same time, to custom it all however you want.
