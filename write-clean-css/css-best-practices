-   Follow a naming convention.

-   Create logical sections in your stylesheet.
Separate basic styles (html, body...) from typography, forms, navigation bars... Better so if you do them in different stylesheets.

-   Avoid over-specific selectors.
If you can work your way around with only classes, not needing child selectors and what not, it'd be better.
That doesn't mean those aren't useful. If you have the same item class in different containers,
you may want to prefix those classes so you can properly manage each element from each container.

-   Avoid !important.

-   Sort CSS properties.
Makes them easier to read and locate, you can select the properties you want to sort,
use the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) and look for "Sort Lines Ascending". That commands takes care of that for you.

-   Take advantage of style inheritance.

-   Extract repetitive patterns.

-   Avoid repetities values (keep it DRY [Don't Repeat Yourself]).
