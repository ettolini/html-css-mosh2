    <!-- You can go to "fontawesome.com" and access their free icons for your projects. You first need to paste the following script... -->

      <!-- The script gives you access to their icons, now you only need to use a tag (like "i" or "span") with the class name of the icon,
      and maybe even add class name properties, and just like that you have a new icon. You can alternatively style them using css,
      just like we do here with the span class, accessing it through the "icon" class.  -->
      <i class="fas fa-bell fa-2x"></i>
      <!-- "fas" stands for "font awesome solid" -> A solid styled Font Awesome icon.
      "fa-bell" stands for "font awesome bell" -> A Font Awesome bell icon.
      "fa-2x" stands for "font awesome 2x" -> A Font Awesome icon with double its original size. -->
