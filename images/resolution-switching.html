    <!-- Sometimes you need to apply resolution switching because devices with same pixel ratio have a significant resolution difference.
    For this, you can provide different images as well, but providing them with the width value (ex: 400w), represents the actual image width.
    To check how many image sizes you should provide, check out the website "responsivebreakpoints.com". -->
